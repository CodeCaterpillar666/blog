## What is sandpack?
[Sandpack's docs](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/) has made it clear enough:
> React components that give you the power of editable sandboxes that run in the browser.

## How do I konw it?
I first know it from [React Docs(Beta)](https://beta.reactjs.org/).
- I started to read through the [learn](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn) part like I did on the older version docs.
- I found some editable, running code block in some docs(for example, [this](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn)).
- I inspected the HTML and I found this:

  ![sandpack in react docs(beta)](./sandpack-in-react-docs-beta.png)

  We could see `sandpack` clearly in the `<div>`'s `class`.

- I googled "sandpack". I found it.

Besides [React Docs(Beta)](https://beta.reactjs.org/), [Sandpack's docs](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/) also lists some other famous projects(at least I have used or heard before) using sandpack:
- GitLab
- Amplify UI
- Storybook

A [blog](https://varun.ca/modular-webgl/#data--state) using sandpack listed on [Sandpack's docs](https://sandpack.codesandbox.io/docs/) drew my attention. 
It uses sandpack to showcase 3d React works. I definitely need to check it in detail.
