Recently I have been building systems on the AWS platform and one repeated work is to locate the `.pem` file and use it to `ssh` to the AWS EC2 instance. My `.pem` file locates deeply so every time I have to type some `cd` to enter into the directory and I feel it is boring. 

One day I found out that alias could save me some time. We could set alias for certain command. For my situation, I am tired of `cd` into nested directories, so I could set a shorter, easy-to-remember alias for the `cd` command. As a result, I only need to type the alias to achieve the same goal - to be at the directory who contains the AWS `.pem` file.

This is how it works in my machine (macbook pro m1 chip):
1. In your terminal, use `alias` to list all existing alias pairs.
2. Set alias at `~/.zshrc`. I used vim, so the command looks like:
   ```
   vim ~./zshrc
   ```
3. Reopen the terminal.
4. Use `alias` agian to confirm the alias works.

Now I only need to type the alias. It makes me feel better.
