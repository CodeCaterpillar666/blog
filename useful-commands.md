- [Deployment](#deployment)

## Deployment
To deploy your local change, replace the `<GibHub Username>` with your own without adding quotes and run the command in your terminal. This may require your access token.
```
GIT_USER=<GitHub Username> yarn deploy
```
So for me, it is:
```
GIT_USER=zwwang98 yarn deploy
```
