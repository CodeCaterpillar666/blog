A servlet is a small Java program that runs within a Web server. Servlets receive and respond to requests from Web clients, usually across HTTP, the HyperText Transfer Protocol. To implement this interface, you can write a generic servlet that extends javax.servlet.\\n\\nSo based on the official docs, `Servlet` is just a Java interface. \\n\\nTo sum up, we could write Java code to implement Servelet and put those code into Apache Tomcat and then we could run these code. We will see how to do that soon.\\n\\n\\n## Servlet Quick Start\\n1. Create a new Java EE project in Intellij IDEA\\n2. Import `Servlet` dependency in `pom.xml`\\n3. Create a new class that implements `Servlet` interface. Override all methods needed(`init()`, `service()` etc.)\\n4. Configure path using annotation `@WebServlet(\\"/demo1\\")`\\n5. Run the project with Apache Tomcat and visite the `Servlet`\\n\\n\\n## `Servlet` as an Interface\\nAs we discussed above, `Servlet` is a Java interface. It difines 5 methods that all classes implementing `Servlet` must override these methods:\\n![servlet method summary](./servlet-method-summary.png)\\n\\nMore details on [Java EE 6](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/Servlet.html).\\n\\nWe should pay more attention on `service()` method, since this method handles requests  and generates responses.\\n\\n\\n## `HttpServlet`\\nAs the name indicates, `HttpServlet` is just a special type of `Servlet`. `HttpServlet` is an abstract Java class implementing `Servlet` interface.\\n\\nAs we could see on Java EE docs:\\n- `public abstract class HttpServlet extends GenericServlet` \\n  (from [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html))\\n- `public abstract class GenericServlet extends Object implements Servlet, ServletConfig, Serializable`\\n  (from [this](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/GenericServlet.html))\\n\\n`HttpServlet` is important because today we usually build server for browser and browser communicate with server on HTTP protocol.\\n\\nHow does `HttpServlet` work? I think [Java EE docs](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html) could give us some hints:\\n> There\'s almost no reason to override the service method. service handles standard HTTP requests by dispatching them to the handler methods for each HTTP request type (the doXXX methods listed above).\\nWe could even implement our own `HttpServlet`:\\n1. Cast the incoming request from `ServletRequest` type into `HttpServletRequest` type\\n2. Check HTTP method name\\n3. Based on HTTP method name of the request, dispatch it to corresponding handler method\\nThe handler methods we metioned above, is just the `doXXX` method in [Java EE HttpServlet](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/api/javax/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html)\\n\\n\\n## Configure `urlPattern` of `Servlet`\\nTo be able to handle request, a `Servlet` need to have its own URLs.\\n\\nWe could configure a `Servlet`\'s URL by annotation `@WebServlet`."},{"id":"tomcat","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/tomcat","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-07-03-tomcat/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-07-03-tomcat/index.md","title":"Apache Tomcat","description":"About Apache Tomcat","date":"2022-07-03T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"July 3, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Apache Tomcat","permalink":"/blog/tags/apache-tomcat"},{"label":"Apache","permalink":"/blog/tags/apache"},{"label":"Java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"},{"label":"Servelet","permalink":"/blog/tags/servelet"}],"readingTime":3.645,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"tomcat","title":"Apache Tomcat","authors":{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"},"tags":["Apache Tomcat","Apache","Java","Servelet"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What is Servlet?","permalink":"/blog/servlet"},"nextItem":{"title":"Useful Shortcuts on Intellij Idea","permalink":"/blog/intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts"}},"content":"## About Apache Tomcat\\nSo what is Tomcat?

Install Apache Tomcat on its (official website)[https://tomcat.apache.org/]. I chose to download Tomcat Version 8 in zip.\\n2. Unzip it wherever you want.\\n\\n### Tomcat Directory Structure\\nTo better understand Tomcat, let\'s check its directory structure. I found something userful from Tomcat [docs](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-3.3-doc/tomcat-ug.html#directory_structure):\\n![tomcat directory structure](./tomcat-directory-structure.png)\\n\\nWe should pay more attention to those folders: `bin`, `conf`, `webapps`.\\n- `bin`: excutable files\\n- `conf`: configurations\\n- `webapps`: web applications\\n\\n### How to Start a Tomcat Server\\n3. In terminal, find the `start.sh` file under `bin` folder. If you are in windows OS, you should run `start.bat` instead.\\n4. Before run it, give permissions to all files ending with `.sh` by running the command below in terminal:  \\n   `chmod +x *.sh`\\n5. Now we could run `./start.sh` in terminal.  \\n   Make sure you are under `./apache-tomcat-{version}/bin/`.\\n6. The terminal will show something like below:\\n   ![tomcat started terminal screenshot](./tomcat-started.png)\\n\\n   Check at [localhost:8080](localhost:8080), you will see something like below:\\n   ![tomcat localhost:8080 screenshot](tomcat-localhost.png)\\n\\n### How to End a Tomcat Server\\nTo end a tomcat server in terminal, run\\n```\\npkill -9 -f tomcat\\n```\\n(from [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15236308/how-do-i-kill-this-tomcat-process-in-terminal))\\n\\n\\n\\n### How to Configure a Tomcat Server\\nWe could configure a Tomcat server in its `/conf/server.xml` file.\\n\\nSay we want to change the PORT. We could configure Tomcat\'s PORT in `/conf/server.xml`. Changing the `port` value is all we need to do.\\n![configure tomcat\'s port](./tomcat-config-port.png)\\n\\nSpecifically, if we configure the PORT as `80`, then we could visit the local Tomcat server without specifying the port on browser url with just `localhost`. This is because `80` is also the PORT for HTTP.\\n\\n\\n### How to Deploy an Application in Tomcat?\\nAll we need to do is put files under `webapps` directory. There are some ways to do so:\\n1. Simply copy original files and paste them under `webapps` directory\\n2. Convert original files into `.war` files, copy those `.war` files and paste them under `webapps` directory. As the [docs](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-3.3-doc/tomcat-ug.html#directory_structure) specified, \\"Any .war files placed here will be automatically expanded\\".\\n\\n\\n## How to Integrate Tomcat in Intellij IDEA?\\n### Add Local Tomcat Server\\nCheck the Intellij IDEA\'s guide on Tomcat Server.\\n> [Run/Debug Configuration: Tomcat Server](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/run-debug-configuration-tomcat-server.html)\\n\\n### Add Tomcat Plugin in `pom.xml`\\nWe could also add Tomcat through `pom.xml`.\\n\\n1. Add Tomcat plugin in `pom.xml`:\\n   ![maven tomcat plugin in pom.xml](./maven-tomcat-plugin.png)\\n\\n2. Use Maven Helper (download from [marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7179-maven-helper)) to start the project:\\n   ![maven hepler run tomcat](./maven-hepler-run-tomcat.png)"},{"id":"intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-06-23-intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-23-intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts.md","title":"Useful Shortcuts on Intellij Idea","description":"Print","date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 23, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Intellij Idea","permalink":"/blog/tags/intellij-idea"},{"label":"Java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"}],"readingTime":0.205,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts","title":"Useful Shortcuts on Intellij Idea","authors":{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"},"tags":["Intellij Idea","Java"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Apache Tomcat","permalink":"/blog/tomcat"},"nextItem":{"title":"Interesting Websites","permalink":"/blog/interesting-websites"}},"content":"### Print\\n1. `sout`: Prints  \\n   `System.out.println();`\\n2. `soutm`: Prints current class and method names to System.out  \\n   `System.out.println(\\"$CLASS_NAME$.$METHOD_NAME$\\");`\\n3. `soutp`: Prints method parameter names and values to System.out  \\n   `System.out.println($FORMAT$);`\\n4. `soutv`: Prints a value to System.out  \\n   `System.out.println(\\"$EXPR_COPY$ = \\" + $EXPR$);`\\n\\n[Source](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38992114/system-out-println-shortcut-on-intellij-idea)"},{"id":"interesting-websites","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/interesting-websites","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-06-23-interestingWebsites/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-23-interestingWebsites/index.md","title":"Interesting Websites","description":"killedbygoogle","date":"2022-06-23T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 23, 2022","tags":[{"label":"Intellij Idea","permalink":"/blog/tags/intellij-idea"},{"label":"Java","permalink":"/blog/tags/java"}],"readingTime":0.04,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"interesting-websites","title":"Interesting Websites","authors":{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"},"tags":["Intellij Idea","Java"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Useful Shortcuts on Intellij Idea","permalink":"/blog/intellij-idea-useful-shortcuts"},"nextItem":{"title":"Useful Resources for Writting Blogs","permalink":"/blog/useful-resources-for-writting-blogs"}},"content":"[killedbygoogle](https://killedbygoogle.com/)\\n![killedbygoogle website screenshot at 2022 June 23rd](./killedbygoogle.png)"},{"id":"useful-resources-for-writting-blogs","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/useful-resources-for-writting-blogs","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-06-22-useful-links-for-writting-blogs.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-22-useful-links-for-writting-blogs.md","title":"Useful Resources for Writting Blogs","description":"markdown syntax","date":"2022-06-22T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 22, 2022","tags":[{"label":"resources","permalink":"/blog/tags/resources"}],"readingTime":0.05,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"useful-resources-for-writting-blogs","title":"Useful Resources for Writting Blogs","authors":{"name":"Ziwei Wang","title":"this website owner","url":"https://github.com/zwwang98","image_url":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/zwwang98.png"},"tags":["resources"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Interesting Websites","permalink":"/blog/interesting-websites"},"nextItem":{"title":"How to Embed Live Code Editor in your Website?","permalink":"/blog/sandpack"}},"content":"### markdown syntax\\n1. https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/\\n2.
